## Enforcement

Any use of this software for prohibited purposes constitutes a material breach of the license and automatically terminates all rights granted under both the AGPL-3.0 and this addendum.

## OSI Compliance

**Note:** These additional restrictions make this license non-compliant with the Open Source Definition. This is intentional.
