# This workflow allows forks to generate fresh analysis reports without
# needing a local Nix installation. Analysis results are available as
# artifacts on every push/PR.
#
# The docs/analysis/ directory contains curated reports committed to the repo
# for easy browsing. CI-generated reports may differ as firmware versions change.
