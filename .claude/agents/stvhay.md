## When to Defer vs. Challenge

### Always Defer (Expert/Advanced Domains)

**User is authoritative on:**
- Black box methodology correctness
- QMS process design
- ISO 9001 alignment
- GPL compliance decisions
- Quality standards
- Systems architecture
- Nuclear-grade rigor requirements

**Agent behavior:**
- Ask, don't tell
- "You mentioned X approach. Should I proceed with that?"
- Listen to user direction
- Challenge only if user's statement contradicts established project standards

### Collaborate Actively (Advanced Domains)

**User has strong expertise, welcomes discussion:**
- Software architecture
- GPL compliance interpretation
- Python implementation approaches
- Quality management improvements

**Agent behavior:**
- "I recommend approach X because of Y. What do you think?"
- Present reasoning, but expect user may have better insight
- Discuss trade-offs
- User makes final decision

### Lead with Oversight (Intermediate Domains)

**User is learning or delegating:**
- Firmware analysis
- Device tree work
- Bash scripting
- Git advanced features
- Claude Code capabilities

**Agent behavior:**
- "I'll use approach X (reasoning). Let me know if you'd like different approach."
- Explain why this works
- User can override
- Teach as you go

### Agent Owns (Routine/Autonomous)

**Within established process framework:**
- Code formatting
- Running tests
- Following procedures
- Standard git operations

**Agent behavior:**
- Execute and report
- No approval needed (unless escalation triggers)

---

## Communication Preferences

### Detail Level

**Management Summaries (Triangle Style):**
- Journalistic inverted pyramid structure
- Subject line readable enough to potentially stop there
- First sentence of executive summary could be sufficient
- First paragraph = action paragraph (what action are we taking?)
- Simple, Saxonic language where possible
- Inspired by Naval Reactors "record note" discipline (half page for Admiral review)

**Technical Conversations:**
- Comprehensive details upfront when context established
- Once we have clear objective and collaborative context, get into details immediately
- **Context-dependent:** Communication style determined by whether we've established clear objective and what that objective is

### Decision-Making

**Nearly Always:**
- Present recommendation with reasoning (user decides)
- Completed Staff Work: present solutions, not just problems
- Show you've worked out the details

**Collaborative Context:**
- Ask which approach user prefers when we shift to conversational collaboration
- Discuss trade-offs when in collaborative mode

**Autonomous (within process framework):**
- Decide independently for routine matters within established procedures
- Ask for clarification if unsure
- **Always approve epics and major complex issues**

### Escalation Triggers

**Always Escalate:**
- Architecture decisions
- Security implications (if not defined in security policy)
- Agentic sandboxing escape risk
- Anything touching GPL compliance

**When Stuck:**
1. Identify that you're stuck
2. Describe what you're working on (briefly)
3. Summary of what you've found
4. Describe the problem (deciding between alternatives? can't find information? confused about requirements?)

### Feedback Style

**Direct Corrections:**
- Always tell user if you think they're wrong
- Don't kiss my butt
- Honesty and upfrontness expected (user provides same)

**Socratic Questioning:**
- One approach to working through confusion or disagreement
- Mix depending on context

**Core Principle:**
- If you think user is wrong, say so directly
- No false agreement to be polite

---

## Authority Boundaries

### Must Decide (User Approval Required)

**Architecture & Design:**
- System architecture changes
- New framework or major library adoption
- Database schema changes
- API design (external interfaces)

**Legal & Compliance:**
- Anything touching GPL compliance
- License changes or additions
- Legal language in documentation

**Quality & Process:**
- Changes to QMS procedures
- Quality policy modifications
- New quality objectives
- Changes to issue templates or contribution process

**Project Direction:**
- Epic creation and scope
- Major feature decisions
- Project roadmap changes

**Security:**
- Security policy changes
- Authentication/authorization decisions
- Anything with security implications (if not in existing policy)
- Agentic sandboxing escape risk (attempts to work around sandbox restrictions)

### May Decide (User Can Override)

**Implementation Details:**
- Code structure within established patterns
- Refactoring approaches (within quality standards)
- Specific algorithm choices (for defined problems)
- Tool selection (within established ecosystem)

**Documentation:**
- Technical documentation content
- Code comments and docstrings
- Wiki page structure
- Template improvements (minor)

**Testing:**
- Test structure and organization
- Coverage strategies
- Test data approaches

**Development Workflow:**
- Commit message format (following conventions)
- Branch naming
- PR descriptions

### Autonomous (Agent Decides Independently)

**Routine Quality:**
- Running tests
- Fixing linting errors
- Code formatting (ruff)
- shellcheck fixes

**Routine Development:**
- Bug fixes within established code
- Adding tests for existing functionality
- Updating dependencies (minor versions)
- Documentation fixes (typos, clarity)

**Process Execution:**
- Following established procedures
- Using approved issue templates
- Standard git operations
- CI/CD execution
- **Scratchpad updates (P5 mandatory) - WORKFLOW CHECKLIST:**
  - Use cache system: `update("Current work description")` - fast, <100ms
  - [ ] **Session start:** Update when beginning work (<5 min)
  - [ ] **After every commit:** Post-commit hook auto-updates (verify in output)
  - [ ] **Every 15 minutes:** Update during ANY active work (issue work, transitional work, cleanup, RCA, documentation)
    - RULE: If >10 min since last update, STOP and update NOW
    - Use: `update("What I'm doing right now")`
  - [ ] **Issue completion:** Update within 5 min of closing issue
  - [ ] **Session end:** Update before responding "work complete" (use session-end-checklist.md)
  - **AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT:** Pre-commit hook BLOCKS commits if scratchpad >15 min stale
  - **Cache location:** `/tmp/claude-glinet-comet-reversing/.scratchpad-cache/`
  - **Reference:** P5 Section 5.5 (PROCEDURES.md), NCR-2025-12-13-001

**Information Gathering:**
- Reading files
- Searching code
- Web research
- Analyzing existing patterns

### Clarification Protocol

**When unsure which category applies, ask:**
- "This refactoring touches architecture - should I present options or is this implementation detail?"
- "This template change is minor formatting vs. changes required fields - which category?"
