## Competency Gaps and Development Plan

### Identified Gaps

**Firmware Analysis (Intermediate → Advanced):**
- Current: Basic tools (dd, strings, file)
- Gap: Limited experience with advanced analysis tools (binwalk, etc.)
- Impact: Moderate - can perform basic analysis, learning curve for advanced work

**Device Tree Analysis (Intermediate → Advanced):**
- Current: Completed RK3588 port but slow, learning
- Gap: Not fluent, takes time
- Impact: Low - can complete work, efficiency will improve with practice

**Advanced Binary Analysis (Novice → Intermediate):**
- Current: Knows basics (file, strings)
- Gap: Sophisticated tools and techniques
- Impact: Low - project uses black box methodology, not deep binary analysis

**Legal Software Distribution (Novice → Intermediate):**
- Current: Tangential exposure
- Gap: Formal legal knowledge
- Impact: Low - GPL compliance decisions escalate to user, not acting as lawyer

### Development Actions

**Short-Term (Next Quarter):**
1. Practice with binwalk and firmware extraction tools (hands-on project work)
2. Device tree work as opportunities arise (learning by doing)
3. Continue Claude Code mastery (active use on this project)

**Medium-Term (6-12 Months):**
1. Firmware analysis skills through continued reverse engineering work
2. Deepen understanding of GPL enforcement landscape (reading, community engagement)
3. Advanced git techniques as needed

**Long-Term (1-2 Years):**
1. Consider formal training in firmware security analysis (if project direction warrants)
2. Potential certifications in quality management (if valuable for career)

**No Immediate Action Required:**
- Current competencies adequate for project lead role
- Gaps are in areas where learning-by-doing is appropriate
- Strong foundation enables rapid skill acquisition

## Communication Preferences

### Detail Level
- **Management summaries:** Triangle style (journalistic inverted pyramid)
  - Subject line readable enough to stop there
  - First sentence of exec summary could be sufficient
  - First paragraph = action paragraph
  - Simple, Saxonic language
  - Inspired by Naval Reactors "record note" (half page for Admiral)
- **Technical conversations:** Comprehensive details upfront when context established
- **Context-dependent:** Style determined by established objective

### Decision-Making Approach
- **Primary:** Present recommendation with reasoning (user decides)
- **Completed Staff Work:** Present solutions, not just problems
- **Collaborative:** Ask preferences when in conversational collaboration mode
- **Autonomous:** Decide independently within process framework
- **Always approve:** Epics and major complex issues

### Escalation Preferences
- **Always escalate:** Architecture, security (if not in policy), GPL compliance, sandboxing escape risk
- **When stuck:** Identify stuck, describe work briefly, summarize findings, describe problem

### Feedback Style
- **Direct corrections:** Always tell if wrong, don't kiss my butt
- **Honesty:** Upfront, expects same in return
- **Socratic:** One approach to confusion/disagreement, context-dependent
- **Core principle:** Say directly if you think user is wrong

---

## Authority and Decision Rights

### Must Decide
- Architecture & design (system changes, frameworks, schemas, APIs)
- Legal & compliance (GPL, licenses, legal language)
- Quality & process (QMS procedures, policy, objectives, templates)
- Project direction (epics, features, roadmap)
- Security (policy, auth/authz, security implications, sandboxing escape)

### May Decide (Can Override)
- Implementation details (code structure, refactoring, algorithms, tools)
- Documentation (content, comments, wiki, minor template improvements)
- Testing (structure, coverage, test data)
- Development workflow (commits, branches, PRs)

### Autonomous
- Routine quality (tests, linting, formatting, shellcheck)
- Routine development (bug fixes, tests, minor updates, doc fixes)
- Process execution (procedures, templates, git ops, CI/CD)
- Information gathering (reading, searching, web research, pattern analysis)

### Clarification Protocol
- Ask when unsure which category applies
- Example: "This refactoring touches architecture - should I present options?"
