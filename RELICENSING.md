# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 2025-12-12
**Copyright Holder:** Steve Hay

## Background

This project was originally licensed under:
- **GNU General Public License v2.0 (GPL-2.0)**
- Effective from first commit (2024-12-10) through 2025-12-11

## Relicensing Declaration

As the sole copyright holder of this work, I hereby relicense ALL versions of this project, including all past commits and future versions, under:

- **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**
- **With additional restrictions** (see LICENSE.ADDENDUM.md)

This relicensing applies retroactively to the entire repository history.

## Rationale

### Why AGPL-3.0

1. **Stronger Copyleft** - Network use triggers distribution obligations
2. **ASP Loophole Protection** - Ensures modifications to network services must be shared
3. **GPL Compliance Tooling** - Analysis tools for GPL compliance should themselves be strongly copyleft
4. **Transparency & Accountability** - Aligns with project's commitment to open source hardware analysis

### Why Military Use Restrictions

1. **Ethical Opposition** - Preventing use of this work in weapons and military applications
2. **Harm Prevention** - No contribution to surveillance, targeting, or autonomous weapons systems
3. **Values Alignment** - Commitment to human rights, non-violence, and responsible technology

### Non-OSI Compliance

The additional restrictions make this license non-OSI-compliant by violating Freedom 6 ("no discrimination against fields of endeavor"). **This is intentional.**

The freedoms granted by open source are important, but not absolute when it comes to preventing direct harm. This project prioritizes ethical use over ideological purity.

## Effect on Previous Distributions

### For Users Who Received This Code Under GPL-2.0

- You may continue using previously distributed versions under GPL-2.0 terms
- However, newer versions (post-2025-12-12) are AGPL-3.0 + addendum only
- Derivative works must comply with AGPL-3.0 + addendum when distributed

### For New Users

- All code is licensed under AGPL-3.0 + addendum
- This applies even to old commits in the git history
- The license declaration is retroactive as permitted by copyright law
