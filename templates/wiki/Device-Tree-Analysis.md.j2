# Device Tree Analysis

Analysis of GL.iNet Comet (RM1) device tree compared to reference Rockchip EVB design.

## Device Identification

The kernel device tree identifies the hardware as:

- **Model**: {{ dt.model | src }}
- **Compatible**: {{ dt.compatible | src }}
- **Reference Board**: {{ dt.reference_board | src }}

## Customization Level

{{ dt.customization_level | capitalize }} customization from reference design.

## Analysis

The GL.iNet firmware's device tree shows:
- Model name changed to "{{ dt.model }}" (product-specific identifier)
- Compatible string maintained as "{{ dt.compatible }}" (hardware compatibility identifier)
- This indicates GL.iNet is using the {{ dt.reference_board }} hardware design with minimal modifications

## GPL Compliance Implications

{{ dt.gpl_implications }}

## Reference Sources

The reference Rockchip device tree sources are available at:

{% for source_url in dt.reference_sources %}
- [{{ source_url.split('/')[-1] }}]({{ source_url }})
{% endfor %}

These files are licensed under GPL-2.0+ or MIT, as documented in their SPDX headers.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed by:
1. Extracting device tree blob (DTB) from firmware
2. Decompiling DTB to device tree source (DTS) using `dtc`
3. Comparing with reference Rockchip EVB DTS from Firefly kernel repository
4. Identifying customizations via diff analysis
